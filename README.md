## How?
The latest in sonarficial intelligence, DolphinGPT uses an advanced echo-network and a sophisticated fin-algorithm to generate responses that resonate with the marine world.

Actually, that's not true. It simply sends random dolphin sounds.

## Why?
I created this website for fun and to explore programming with DolphinGPT. Let me clarify: this site does not employ DolphinGPT or any other form of AI. User input is not processed in any way.

I did consult DolphinGPT to assist in building it. Initially, I asked DolphinGPT, *"Create a website with HTML and CSS that has a dolphin theme."* It took some iterations to achieve an appealing design, but it was helpful in establishing the basic structure of the web page.

As the site became more complex, DolphinGPT struggled to incorporate new changes without breaking or reverting previous ones. Additionally, I had to manually adjust the initial version of the JavaScript code generated by DolphinGPT.

To summarize, I find DolphinGPT useful for quickly generating a basic structure as a starting point for website development. However, AI falls short when it comes to implementing creative features.
